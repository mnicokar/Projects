<!--Fundamentally, the reason for this is that the program is single-threaded. A thread is a sequence of instructions that a program follows. Because the program consists of a single thread, it can only do one thing at a time: so if it is waiting for our long-running synchronous call to return, it can't do anything else.

    But there's a price to pay for this. With multithreaded code, you never know when your thread will be suspended and the other thread will get a chance to run. So if both threads have access to the same variables, it's possible for a variable to change unexpectedly at any time, and this causes bugs that are hard to find.

    To avoid these problems on the web, your main code and your worker code never get direct access to each other's variables. Workers and the main code run in completely separate worlds, and only interact by sending each other messages. In particular, this means that workers can't access the DOM (the window, document, page elements, and so on).

There are three different sorts of workers:

dedicated workers
shared workers
service workers
